            <h1>Beng Tech Electrical graduate</h1>

            <p>
                I have completed my degree in 2020 and graduation 
                date was supposed to be held on 19th October 2020.
                Due to Covid 19, the graduation ceremony was held virtually.
                2020 and 2021 graduates were given another opportunity to 
                celebrate by organising a Graduation ceremony for the 
                two groups. I was in the first group of Beng Tech in South 
                Africa as the qualification started first at UJ in 2017.

                My Mother accompanied me to the stage crossing ceremony 
                which was held on the 19th July 2022 at UJ Soweto campus.
                I was sitted next to my Friend Masina Sydwell whom I met in 2017 
                during our first year, we have been close since then: working
                together in the Lab and hanging out with him. we developed similar
                interests of Software Development.
